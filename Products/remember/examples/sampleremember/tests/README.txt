ReMember's test runner was also trying to run example/sampleremember tests
so renamed the sampleremember one so it doesn't run.

Rename DISABLED_test_install.py to test_install.py to run SampleRemember tests.

TODO: sampleremember should probably end up as its own product and not part of
      remember.

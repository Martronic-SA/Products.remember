  step registration from python code and xml to zcml, and creating
  upgrade steps to get rid of persistent import steps and update the
  existing getRoles index from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex.

* Changed getRoles from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex in the
  membrane_tool, so you can search for roles.

------------------

* allow usage of portal_registration tools  ALLOWED_MEMBER_ID_PATTERN. This 
  does not change any current behaviour, it may be made configurable ttw in 
  future. Introduced new config.py variable USE_PORTAL_REGISTRATION_PATTERN
  set to False by default. Setting to True switches to portal_registrations
  getIDPattern.

* Fix inefficiency in prefs_users_overview where searchUsers is called when 
  no search string is supplied. The bug meant that the page would be extremely 
  slow even when just navigating to prefs_users_overview.

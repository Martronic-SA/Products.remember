Changelog
=========

1.9b1 - Unreleased
------------------

* Products.remember no longer disrupts non-membrane membership when
  Products.remember is present but not yet quick-installed.
  [2010-10-25 klm]

* Products.remember now works with membrane 2.0 (and Plone 4):

  - Removed and/or converted "I*Avail" interfaces
  - Added missing BaseMember.getUserId() method
  - Make BaseMember Provide IMembraneUserAuth, so it can do
    .authenticateCredentials(), and
  - Implemented BaseMember.authenticateCredentials() method to be
    used instead of the version removed from membrane.

  NOTE WELL:

  If you have sites with pre-existing member objects you must update their
  membrane_tool catalog when you upgrade.  Via the ZMI in your site's
  membrane_tool, select the 'Advanced' tab and 'Update Catalog' to
  reconcile existing index entries.

* Modernized GenericSetup configuration, moving the profile and import
  step registration from python code and xml to zcml, and creating
  upgrade steps to get rid of persistent import steps and update the
  existing getRoles index from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex.

* Changed getRoles from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex in the
  membrane_tool, so you can search for roles.

* Use Plone 3's JS schemata/fieldset switching.

* allow usage of portal_registration tools  ALLOWED_MEMBER_ID_PATTERN. This 
  does not change any current behaviour, it may be made configurable ttw in 
  future. Introduced new config.py variable USE_PORTAL_REGISTRATION_PATTERN
  set to False by default. Setting to True switches to portal_registrations
  getIDPattern.

* Fix inefficiency in prefs_users_overview where searchUsers is called when 
  no search string is supplied. The bug meant that the page would be extremely 
  slow even when just navigating to prefs_users_overview.

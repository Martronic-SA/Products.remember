Pending TODOs:

- simplify member-object workflow design and operation by using content
  rules to detect member profile changes and trigger automatic transitions,
  rather than Extensions/triggerAutomaticTransitions keyed on the update
  methods.  (i have a working implementation in a subproduct, but it would
  need some backwards compat provisions for existing member based content.)

- Reconcile membership account's incidentals - preferences / dashboard /
  password-change stuff - with standard membership provisions, so there
  aren't multiple and disparate places to set things.  similarly, integrate
  the portal_memberdata container with views that make it useful.

- simplify extension and customization of member profile schemas, perhaps
  by migrating to dexterity.
  - todo added by klm, 2011-07-07

- complete the uninstall provisions, so portals from which
  Products.remember was uninstalled do not depend in any way on
  Products.remember code being present.
